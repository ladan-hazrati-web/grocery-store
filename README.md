# Grocery Store Project (Inspired by Woodmart)



## Description

A grocery shopping website where users can sign up, log in (via email/password or GitHub), browse and filter products, add items to the cart or wishlist, and manage their orders. Admins can manage **user comments** through a dashboard; approved comments appear under products. The cart uses **localStorage** to persist products across sessions.
